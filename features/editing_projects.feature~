Feature: Editing projects
  As a user
  In order to update project information
  I want to do that through an interface
  
Scenario: Updating a project
  Given there is a project called "TextMate 2"
  And I am on the homepage
  When I follow "TextMate 2"
  And I follow "Edit Project"
  And I fill in "Name" with "TextMate 2 beta"
  And I press "Update Project"
  Then I should see "Project has been updated."
  And I should be on the project page for "TextMate 2 beta"
